## Introduction
>The purposes of Studbud is to help remote learning students to study more efficiency. Therefore, my target audience is foreign students who are studying remotely in their countries. Because of the time zones, they must attend classes and submit assignments according to Australian time. They must account for jet lag, which could result in missing examinations or classes. Moreover, remote learning creates communication barriers and the lack of a learning environment which reduces the efficiency of study.

## Design principles
### Similarity
>People associate have the same characteristics elements with the same functions or features, such as the same shape, colour, size, etc. (Harley, 2020). The icons on the navigation bar are the same size and the same visuals which from google material design. That can convey these two elements has identical features which can navigate the user to that page.

### Consistency
>It is making the elements with the same colour, fonts, or having key features to indicate their relevance (Nikolov, 2017). I use colour consistency which is the major colour of my web app Pomodoro red. And my logo and favicon are using the same colour, fonts, and same appearance. If the logo is a different style, user may feel this is not the same Studbud, because of cognitive bias.

### Proximity
>The distance between elements represents relevance. More close means more relevant and vice versa(Harley, 2020). The distance between each column is closer which can look more like a whole. It can make users know, that the task card can be added to the column rather than other places.

## Iteration
### Pomodoro timer
>I removed the function of adding cycles, according to the flow theory in UX design, people should avoid external factors distracting them when they are focusing. So if people are immersed in a cycle, they shouldn't think about adding more cycles. So I turn it into an automatic cycle which is people end this cycle and the next cycle starts automatically. 

>And then I changed the period to be represented by a pomodoro to a number. It's easier to show users how many cycles they've gone through and avoid counting the number of Pomodoros.

### Logo
>I changed the look of the logo to keep it consistent with the favicon. Change the rectangular logo to a square one because the square one is more suitable for the favicon. I found stud and bud has the same letter "u" and "d", so I combine these two letters. Using a unique design for a logo can make users more likely to remember my logo and improve the recognizability of the web app.

### Add button
>I have two add(+) buttons that can add task cards which are at the top right corner of columns and another one at the bottom right corner of the page. Because of the same functions, it will make users feel confused and make more operations. So I remove the add(+ ) button which is on the bottom right corner. Users can add task cards according to the column where they want the task list to be.

## Reflection
>I have some functions that have not been achieved such as drag and drop the task card to the other columns function and top the card features. I need to have further learned Java script and think deeper. Through this assignment, I deepened my understanding of HTML and CSS and learned how Java script works. For unimplemented code, go deeper into the winter vacation.
